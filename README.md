# pacmanMachineLearning

### Overview
Contains different code sections for training a pacman agent

Deep Q-networks are used to train pacman agent using higher order action relative inputs studied in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6615002)
actions are then associated with rewards and using epsilon greedy algorithms to train the agent over a long period of time to create an efficient agent

Experimentation using NEAT-ai to create a better agent through the use of natural selection and random topologies of networks for the models instead of traditional reinforcement learning
